this is my first tailwind css website. 


hello developers , i have uploaded a project built on tailwindcss , i learnt the course on udemy... i dont no much about git as i am a newbie to this.
if anyone viewing this would like to run the code on ur computer then i would elaborate how to install and run tailwind so then u can copy the code and check the webiste 
,firstly install node.js then go to the terminal in VS code and click on terminal { command + j } now write { npm init -y} , then { npm install tailwindcss@2.2.16}
later u have to edit the json package with { "build" : "tailwind build src/style.css -o public/style.css }.. once this is done go back to terminal and type 
{ npm run build } ..and thats it u are good to go.. tailwind is on ur ide..
thankyou...
